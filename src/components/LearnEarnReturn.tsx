        Even as a student, you can help your Alma Mater.
        <br></br><br></br>
        IT Kharagpur is helping students to learn without being unduly worried about expenses, shape their career and then give back to their Alma Mater through the grassroots campaign of Learn-Earn-Return. This scheme aims to create a financial support system for students so that they imbibe the culture of giving back. Students availing benefits under this scheme will be required to take a ‘Pledge’ of giving back to the Institute. ‘Giving back’ by the alumni has brought about a transformation on various fronts at the Institute, one of them being student excellence.<br></br><br></br>"The concept of Learn-Earn-Return is to support a student and enable in him/her the vision of extending similar support as an alumnus towards future generations of students at IIT Kharagpur. So it's a full circle of life which LER represents," says Prof. Partha Pratim Chakrabarti, Director, IIT Kharagpur.<br></br>The awardees will receive Rs 10,000 per month for 4 years as cash award. At the end of the first semester of the 1st year, the award will be given out on the basis of JEE Advanced rank [Rank - top 200 for male and top 250 for female]. From the second semester onward, the recipients of the award would have to maintain a CGPA of 9. The first awards were announced during the Annual Alumni Meet 2018. Three first year students -Jyoti Agrawal, Jyotisman Das and Rathin Singha - from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering received the award in the presence of about 300 alumni who had come from all over India and abroad. Current year recipients 2019-2020 - Jyoti Agrawal, Debajyoti Kar and Rathin Singha - from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. You can come forward to help meritorious students, who come from families with limited financial capability, to follow their dream. In their turn, such students promise to return the favour by giving back to the Institute - just the way you did.<br></br><br></br>
        Testimonial from LER recipients: "LER is unique in the way it enables us to meet various expenses associated with academics and research projects. I have taken the pledge to give back to my Alma Mater as I grow in life," said Jyotisman Das. "I am elated with the award as it is an honour to stand in front of the alumni and be a recipient of their care and affection. Also I feel the girls in the country and their parents should know about this award and feel motivated to pursue a career in engineering," said Jyoti Agrawal. Rathin Singha pointed out that LER would help him pursue his studies without worrying about the financial burden that families of limited means often have to face.
