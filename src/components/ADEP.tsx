    A new initiative was started in 2018 to raise funds for various departmental events and campaigning. This program named as <strong>"Alumni Department Engagement Program - ADEP"</strong>  is aimed to reconnect alumni with their departments. This program facilitates alumni and dept: for initiatives like - visiting faculty, special lectures, workshops, foreign and industry collaboration, PG and RS placement, internships, and live projects. Under this campaign for the first time in the history of the Institute, a Geoscience seminar was organized at the Geology and Geophysics Dept totally from the resources contributed by the alumni. In 2019 again the Alumni of the 1975 batch of Ocean Engineering & Naval Architecture came forward to support their department by accumulating a handsome fund of Rs. 8 Lakh to build a state-of-the-art auditorium.
