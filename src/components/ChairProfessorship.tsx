    are also a great initiative where illustrious alumni contribute. Endowed Professorship is one of the highest honors awarded in the academic arena and is reserved for the best faculty members as an acknowledgment of their contributions to research and teaching. The endowed Chair also lends an additional prestige to the departments. Thus, it is both an honor to the named holder of the appointment and also an enduring tribute to the donor who establishes it.
