        Own Your Hall Room
      </h1>
      <p className='mt-6'>
        Over the years we have received unprecedented support from our esteemed alumni for various Developmental Projects of IITKGP.<br></br><br></br>
        Amongst all the initiatives run by the institute, the Hall Development Campaign is one of the well supported campaigns from the alumni. The Halls which are considered as their second home always remain close to their heart. It all started with the former Director of IIT Kharagpur, Prof. Damodar Acharya donating for renovating the hall rooms where he stayed.<br></br><br></br>The institute soon thought that this will be an wonderful opportunity for the alumni to keep their signature on their very own campus. A hall room will have multiple occupants over years and we know many of them will come forward with the endowment. The donor of any particular hall room will be recognized but putting individual plaques in their name with batch and department which will be placed inside the room on one outside of the room, on first come first serve basis.<br></br>With this noble idea, the Office of Alumni Affairs & Branding has started a new campaign, OWN YOUR HALL ROOM. By donating a sum of INR 2.5L, along with a maintenance fees after every 5 years, you can have your hall room named after you, modernizing its infrastructure.<br></br><br></br>
        This will allow the present students of the institute to have a comfortable stay at the campus as well.
