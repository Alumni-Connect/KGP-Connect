    IIT-KGP has always been the source of enlightenment and inspiration to thousands of youth for more than six decades. It was the dream of independent India to take the quality of its higher education to world class standard and IIT-KGP has successfully achieved it. However, in this new era, the challenge is bigger. With more institutions including IITs coming up, the need for greater professionalism at every stage of management and innovations driven research has become very important in educational institutions.
      <br></br><br></br>
      The utilisation of the endowment fund will be controlled by the members of IIT KGP Endowment Committee consisting of the Director - IIT Kharagpur, the Deputy Director – IIT Kharagpur, the Dean Outreach – IIT Kharagpur, the Associate Dean Alumni Affairs & Branding – IIT Kharagpur & the Registrar – IIT Kharagpur and will be presented to the donors through our annual report. The Founding Endowment Batches would be given the privilege to name a classroom with names of all the generous contributors firmly engraved. It is our way to help our donors leave their legacy behind. The batches and the contributors would be remembered by all the batches of technocrats passing out from IIT KGP.
