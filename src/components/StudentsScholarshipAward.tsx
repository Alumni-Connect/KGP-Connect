      It is very important for students to recognize their own potential early in their academic career so that they foster its growth—receiving recognition from an organization or company helps students take this step. A merit scholarship confirms that a student is capable and will be a great addition to any academic institution or organization.IIT Kharagpur has a number of student scholarships, many given by corporations, foundations and external agencies.
