    The Institute wants to excel its position as an academic and research driven institute with an impact that goes beyond the nation. With new IITs coming up there is a decreasing trend in funding from current sources. This would need more funding from other sources. This fund will help in research & innovations, offer attractive remunerations to faculty and sustain other student oriented initiatives not funded by the Government. This fund needs to be built through regular donations over a long period of time and put into an institute endowment which will take care of future needs.
